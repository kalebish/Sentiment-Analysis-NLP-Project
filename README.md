# Sentiment-Analysis-NLP-Project

# Steps 

### 1. Open sentiment_analyzer_resampled.ipynb
The model trained here uses CountVectorizer to extract the text features. There is also a model that uses TfidfVectorizer.  

### 2. Run the cells to train the model
Make sure to <b> run the necessary cells </b> in the sentiment_analyzer_resampled.ipynb file before running the app. It needs the model trained in the former.
### 2. Use the UI (optional)
If you want a UI application, we have prepared a tkinter app. Run via
<code> python app.py </code>
