# Sentiment-Analysis-NLP-Project


# Steps 

### Run the sentiment_analyzer_resampled notebook cells to train the model
There is also a model that uses TfidfVectorizer. The former uses CountVectorizer. 

### UI
If you want a UI application, we have prepared a tkinter app. Run via
<code> python app.py </code>

NB: Make sure to run the necessary cells in the sentiment_analyzer_resampled.ipynb file before running the app. It needs the model trained in the former.
